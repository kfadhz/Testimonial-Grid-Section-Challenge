                “I was an EMT for many years before I joined the bootcamp.
                I’ve been looking to make a transition and have heard some people who had an amazing experience here.
                I signed up for the free intro course and found it incredibly fun!
                I enrolled shortly thereafter. The next 12 weeks was the best - and most grueling - time of my life.
                Since completing the course, I’ve successfully switched careers, working as a Software Engineer at a VR startup.”

                “Before joining the bootcamp, I’ve never written a line of code.
                I needed some structure from professionals who can help me learn programming step by step.
                I was encouraged to enroll by a former student of theirs who can only say wonderful things about the program.
                The entire curriculum and staff did not disappoint. They were very hands-on and I never had to wait long for assistance.
                The agile team project, in particular, was outstanding.
                It took my learning to the next level in a way that no tutorial could ever have.
                In fact, I’ve often referred to it during interviews as an example of my developent experience.
                It certainly helped me land a job as a full-stack developer after receiving multiple offers.
                100% recommend! ”
